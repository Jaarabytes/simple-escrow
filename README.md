**This is a sample, I am not liable for any funds lost or misplaced. Thank you!**

Escrow consists of:

-   **Seller**: This is the address that withdraws funds or ether out of the escrow smart contract.
-   **Amount**: Amount of funds deposited into the smart contract

-   **NOTE**: The contract keeps 5% of the funds stored.
              The funds have to stay in the contract for a minimum of 6 hours.
